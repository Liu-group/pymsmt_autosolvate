The mol2 files in this directory are generated based on the
AMBER force field lib files and tleap software.
Users can go to Amber website (http://ambermd.org/) to get
the most recent version of the lib files.

The default force field in MCPB.py is ff14SB in this version.
Former force fields are not recommended for using in the
research, but kept in the software for user's interest.
